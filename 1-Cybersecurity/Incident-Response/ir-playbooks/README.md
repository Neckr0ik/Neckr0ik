## Evidence Collection Guidelines

### Digital Evidence Handling
1. **Preservation Order**
   - Volatile memory (RAM)
   - Network connections
   - Running processes
   - Temporary files
   - Log files
   - Disk images

2. **Chain of Custody**
   - Document all evidence handling
   - Maintain chronological records
   - Secure storage and access controls
   - Legal admissibility requirements

3. **Forensic Tools**
   - Memory acquisition: `volatility`, `lime`
   - Disk imaging: `dd`, `dcfldd`, `ewfacquire`
   - Network analysis: `wireshark`, `tcpdump`
   - Log analysis: `grep`, `awk`, `splunk`

### Evidence Collection Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Evidence collection automation

INCIDENT_ID="$1"
EVIDENCE_DIR="/var/evidence/${INCIDENT_ID}"

# Create evidence directory
mkdir -p "$EVIDENCE_DIR"

# Collect system information
uname -a > "$EVIDENCE_DIR/system_info.txt"
ps aux > "$EVIDENCE_DIR/processes.txt"
netstat -tulpn > "$EVIDENCE_DIR/network_connections.txt"

# Collect logs
cp /var/log/auth.log "$EVIDENCE_DIR/"
cp /var/log/syslog "$EVIDENCE_DIR/"
cp /var/log/apache2/access.log "$EVIDENCE_DIR/" 2>/dev/null

# Calculate checksums
find "$EVIDENCE_DIR" -type f -exec sha256sum {} \; > "$EVIDENCE_DIR/checksums.txt"

echo "Evidence collected in: $EVIDENCE_DIR"
```

## Incident Severity Classification

### Severity Levels

#### Critical (P1)
- **Impact**: Complete service outage or data breach
- **Response Time**: 15 minutes
- **Escalation**: Immediate executive notification
- **Examples**: Ransomware, major data breach, complete system compromise

#### High (P2)
- **Impact**: Significant service degradation or security compromise
- **Response Time**: 1 hour
- **Escalation**: Management notification within 2 hours
- **Examples**: Partial system compromise, targeted attacks, service disruption

#### Medium (P3)
- **Impact**: Limited service impact or potential security issue
- **Response Time**: 4 hours
- **Escalation**: Team lead notification
- **Examples**: Malware detection, policy violations, minor breaches

#### Low (P4)
- **Impact**: Minimal or no service impact
- **Response Time**: 24 hours
- **Escalation**: Standard reporting
- **Examples**: Failed login attempts, suspicious activity, informational alerts

## Legal and Regulatory Considerations

### Notification Requirements

- **Threshold**: High risk to rights and freedoms
- **Content**: Nature, categories, consequences, measures

#### HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- **Timeline**: 60 days to HHS, affected individuals
- **Threshold**: Unsecured PHI compromise
- **Content**: Description, investigation, mitigation

#### PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- **Timeline**: Immediately to card brands and acquirer
- **Threshold**: Suspected or confirmed compromise
- **Content**: Incident details, impact assessment, response actions

### Documentation Requirements
- Incident timeline and chronology
- Response actions and decisions
- Evidence collection and analysis
- Communication records
- Lessons learned and improvements

## Integration with Security Tools

### SIEM Integration
```python
# Example SIEM alert processing
import json
import requests

def process_siem_alert(alert_data):
    incident_type = classify_incident(alert_data)
    severity = assess_severity(alert_data)
    
    # Create incident record
    incident = create_incident(
        type=incident_type,
        severity=severity,
        source_data=alert_data
    )
    
    # Trigger appropriate playbook
    playbook = select_playbook(incident_type)
    execute_playbook(playbook, incident)
    
    return incident
```

### Ticketing System Integration
```python
# Example ServiceNow integration
def create_incident_ticket(incident_data):
    ticket_data = {
        'short_description': incident_data['title'],
        'description': incident_data['description'],
        'urgency': map_severity_to_urgency(incident_data['severity']),
        'category': 'Security',
        'subcategory': incident_data['type']
    }
    
    response = requests.post(
        f"{SERVICENOW_URL}/api/now/table/incident",
        json=ticket_data,
        auth=(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
    )
    
    return response.json()
```
