## 🌟 Professional Journey

Transitioning from media leadership to tech, my background in broadcasting (e.g., managing IT for live TV, global film releases at Record TV) equips me with skills in secure digital workflows, audience analytics, and cross-cultural collaboration. As a trilingual professional (Portuguese, Spanish, English), I apply methodical problem-solving from roles like Broadcast IT Manager to forge resilient tech solutions. This portfolio bridges my past in content strategy and localization to future-focused projects in security and data.
