# Cloud Engineering Projects

Infrastructure as Code and cloud-native solutions for secure scalability. Inspired by digital content delivery and OTT optimizations.

## Project Areas

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure as Code
Secure blueprints for deploying cloud resources with automated provisioning and configuration management.
- **azure-secure-blueprint**: Comprehensive Azure infrastructure templates

### üîí Cloud Security (Work in Progress)
Tools and frameworks for auditing cloud environments and maintaining security posture.
- **Placeholder for future cloud security tools**

## Getting Started

Each project contains:
- `README.md` with detailed setup instructions
- Infrastructure code and configuration files
- Security best practices and compliance guidelines
- Deployment automation and CI/CD integration

## Prerequisites

- Cloud provider account (Azure, AWS, or GCP)
- Terraform 1.0+ for infrastructure provisioning
- Understanding of cloud security principles
- Experience with Infrastructure as Code concepts

## Cloud Security Framework

### Security by Design
- **Identity and Access Management**: Role-based access controls
- **Network Security**: Virtual networks, firewalls, and segmentation
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails
- **Compliance**: Industry standards and regulatory requirements

### Infrastructure Principles
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Version-controlled, reproducible deployments
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal required permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Automated Security**: Continuous compliance monitoring

## Learning Integration

Projects align with cloud engineering best practices:
- **Infrastructure as Code** methodologies and tools
- **Cloud security** frameworks and implementations
- **DevOps practices** for secure deployments
- **Monitoring and observability** for cloud environments
