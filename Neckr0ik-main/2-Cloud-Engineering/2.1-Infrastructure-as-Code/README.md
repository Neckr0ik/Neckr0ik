# Infrastructure as Code Projects

Secure blueprints for deploying cloud resources with automated provisioning, configuration management, and security best practices.

## Projects

### ☁️ azure-secure-blueprint
Comprehensive Azure infrastructure template implementing security best practices, compliance frameworks, and scalable architecture patterns.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-tier architecture with proper network segmentation
- Identity and access management with Azure AD integration
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Monitoring, logging, and alerting configuration
- Compliance with security frameworks (CIS, NIST)

**Skills:** Terraform, Azure, Security Architecture, Compliance

## Getting Started

Each project contains:
- `README.md` with detailed setup and configuration instructions
- Terraform modules for infrastructure components
- Security configuration and compliance templates
- Deployment automation and CI/CD pipeline examples

## Prerequisites

- **Cloud Provider Account**: Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- **Terraform**: Version 1.0+ for infrastructure provisioning
- **Azure CLI**: For authentication and resource management
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration

## Infrastructure Principles

### Security by Design
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal required permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Encryption Everywhere**: Data protection at all levels

### Operational Excellence
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Version-controlled, reproducible deployments
- **Automated Testing**: Validation and compliance checking
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Comprehensive observability
- **Disaster Recovery**: Backup and recovery procedures

### Cost Optimization
- **Resource Tagging**: Proper cost allocation and tracking
- **Right-sizing**: Appropriate resource allocation
- **Reserved Instances**: Cost-effective long-term commitments
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic resource adjustment
